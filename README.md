# Sentiment_Classification_on_Restaurant_Reviews
 
The task is to classify sentiments of customers given on restaurants. A logistic regression function has been used to build a supervised classifier, using simple feature engineering tricks like TF-IDF. However, the dataset was too small to build a robust, high-performing classifier. Hence, I built a semi-supervised classifier to systematically increment the size of the training batch by using the predictions of the supervised classifier. Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful in scenarios where the training data is too small to build a useful supervised classifier. The semi-supervised classifier improvises upon the supervised classifier and generally gives a better performance. The detailed implementation can be found in the report. Read the README file for reproducibility.
