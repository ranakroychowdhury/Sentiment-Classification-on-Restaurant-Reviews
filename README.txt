There are two python files in this folder and a README file:

- (classify.py): This file implements the classifer model used, which is Logistic Regression and implements the evaluation function to compare the set of predicted labels to the actual labels to compute accuracy.

- (sentiment.py): The primary file to run. This file contains methods to read the appropriate data files from the archive, train evaluate the model and find the most representative features of each class learned by the model.

- (README): Contains all the necessary information about the file structure and information about each file.
